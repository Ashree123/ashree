DEVELOPEMENT OF C

DEVELOPER-Dennis Ritche and Bell Labs

STABLE RELEASE C-11/DEC/11;six years ago

HISTORY-In the 1960s Ritchie worked, with several other employees of Bell Labs (AT&T), on a project called Multics.

The goal of the project was to develop an operating system for a large computer that could be used by a thousand users. 
The programming language C was written down, by Kernighan and Ritchie, 
in a now classic book called “The C Programming Language, 1st edition”. 

The goal of the project was to develop an operating system for a large computer that could be used by a thousand users.
For years the book “The C Programming Language, 1st edition” was the standard on the language C.
In 1983 a committee was formed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
to develop a modern definition for the programming language C (ANSI X3J11).
In 1988 they delivered the final standard definition ANSI C. (The standard was based on the book from K&R 1st ed.).

PROGRAM IN C-
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
printf("C is a programming language");
}
